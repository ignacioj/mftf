mftf.exe v.2.7.2
The tool can parse the $MFT from a live system, from a mounted (read-only
included) logical drive or from a copy of the $MFT.
It can copy files or ADS,s using the references provided in the results.
The copy is made by reading the data from the clusters so that you can copy
protected system files or files in use.
Deleted files and folders have their path with the prefix ""?"".

Usage:
-k  This option will keep the session open and the origins will be cached. Successive queries
    will benefit from a higher response speed. You can change the origin and return without time penalty.
