mftf.exe v.2.8
Raw copy files and search using the content of the MFT.
The tool can parse the $MFT from a live system, from a mounted (read-only
included) logical drive or from a copy of the $MFT.
It can copy files or ADS,s directly or using references.
The copy is made by reading the data from the clusters so that you can copy
protected system files or files in use.
Deleted files and folders have their path with the prefix "?".
